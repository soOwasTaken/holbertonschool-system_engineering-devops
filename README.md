### Server : 
This is a computer that provides data to other computers. It hosts websites and supports related services like email, file sharing, and more. In our case, it hosts the web server, application server, and database.

### Domain Name :
This is the address where users can access your website. In our case, it's www.foobar.com. The domain name is translated into an IP address (8.8.8.8 in our case) through DNS.

### DNS Record :
The 'www' in www.foobar.com is a type of DNS record. It's a subdomain that usually points to the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

### Web Server (Nginx) :

This software handles HTTP requests from users and serves the requested web pages. It acts as a mediator between the user's browser and the application server.

### Application Server :

This is where your application code runs. It interacts with the user's requests and the database, processing the business logic of your application.

### Database (MySQL) :

This is where your data is stored. The application server queries the database to fetch or store data.

### Communication :

The server communicates with the user's computer using HTTP or HTTPS protocols. These protocols are used to send the requested web pages from the server to the user's browser.

### However, this infrastructure has some issues :

#### Single Point of Failure (SPOF) :
Since everything is hosted on a single server, if that server goes down, the entire website goes down.

#### Downtime during Maintenance :
If you need to perform maintenance tasks like deploying new code or restarting the web server, the website will be unavailable during that time.

#### Scalability Issues :
If your website receives a lot of traffic, a single server may not be able to handle all the requests. This can lead to slow response times or even server crashes.
